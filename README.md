## Problems trying to solve


### People

- Rule enforcement
For security reasons, we need to enforce 2FA, having email address on profile, as well as having real name (FirstName LastName) on profile.


- Kick alumni out
It is hard for a large organisation's Github repository maintainers to know if an user in the Github organisation is no longer working for the org and should be removed.

- New-Starter manual burden
New team members need to come to us repo maintainers to request write access. Ideally, new members should be given access automatically if their name could be found in Active Directory service. _And Dev Leads should be assigned as team admin who can self-manage_


### Team

- 1 tribe - 1 team
Github Teams are arbitrarily created, not ideally created by `1 tribe - 1 team ` policy.


### Repo

- Zombie Repos
It is time-consuming to tell which repositories have been collecting dust for years, and taking limited quota we have on Github. The quota costs, and zombie repos should be archieved.

- No repo backup procedure
We as an organisaion don't have automated process to backup/archieve Github repo to AWS-S3 buckets.
