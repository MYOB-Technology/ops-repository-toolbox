## Problems trying to solve

### It is hard for a large organisation's Github repository maintainers to know if an user in the Github organisation is no longer working for the org and should be removed.

### Teams are arbitrarily created, not ideally created by `1 tribe - 1 team ` policy.

### New team members need to come to us repo maintainers to request write access. Ideally, new members should be given access automatically if their name could be found in Active Directory service. _And Dev Leads should be assigned as team admin who can self-manage_

### It is time-consuming to tell which repositories have been collecting dust for years, and taking limited quota we have on Github. The quota costs, and zombie repos should be archieved.

### We as an organisaion don't have automated process to backup/archieve Github repo to AWS-S3 buckets.
